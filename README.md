# NeuroImageAnalysis

NeuroImageAnalysis (also known as NIA) is a Java program for analyzing how positive a stain is on sets of images from brain slides. 

Note: this will continue to be the purpose of the program for at least the 2.0 series of releases. However, I do hope that one day this program may be more flexible. 

## What to download

The master branch now is only host to the licensing and documentation files for the NIA project, as well as the source code for the development of the program and its features. This means that the code downloaded from this branch very well be disfunctional for non-developer use. To use the NIA program, it is strongly recommended to simply download and run the latest JAR file from the "patcher" branch. Note that the patcher may need to take some time to download the entire program over again, on the first run and on updates. After the first run, this program is completely capable of running offline. 

Due to a bug, it may be necessary to start the patcher up to three times to actually download the program. If the program still doesn't download after a few attempts and you are certain there is an internet connection present, feel free to contact me.


## Documentation
The documentation for this project is in the works, along with an initial release of the program itself. There are old copies of the documentation along with older writes of the program in the Releases section of this repository, but those have their own individual flaws, and have no built in upgrading system, as the new (still in the works) version does. They also aren't as well documented as the newer version. 

In sort, if you really need a functional program, download one of the releases. However, if you can hold out until the next release, you'll be much better off.

## Licensing
Packaged along with the project is a JAR archive with binary code from Sun Microsystems, Inc. The licences for the packaged archive are in the directory titled "LICENSES" on the master branch. If there is trouble with this usage of the binary code, I ask that you contact me and I'll remove it from the project as soon as possible. I believe that, with this arrangement, my program is easier for users to use, and that Sun gets the credit they deserve for their contribution to the project.
