# NeuroImageAnalysis

NeuroImageAnalysis (also known as NIA) is a Java program for analyzing how positive a stain is on sets of images from brain slides. 

Note: this will continue to be the purpose of the program for at least the 2.0 series of releases. However, I do hope that one day this program may be more flexible. 

## What to download

The master branch of the repository is where the code development takes place. This means that the code downloaded from this branch very well be disfunctional for non-developer use. To use the NIA program, it is strongly recommended to simply download and run (the latest JAR file)[https://github.com/twtduck/NeuroImageAnalysis/raw/patcher/NIA%20Launcher.jar] from the "patcher" branch. After the first run, this program is completely capable of running offline. 

Due to a bug, it may be necessary to start the patcher up to three times to actually download the program. If the program still doesn't download after a few attempts and you are certain there is an internet connection present, feel free to contact me.
