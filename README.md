# NeuroImageAnalysis
Java program for analyzing how positive a stain is on sets of images from brain slides.

## How to use this program

To run this program, the following commands must be run from the repository's parent directory:
```
./compile
cd bin
java Main
```
To clean up, I've written a script to remove all files from the bin directory. It can be easily run with:
```
./clean
```
Note that this script may remove other files if it's not run from the repository's parent directory.

## Files in the parent directory

There are a few files in the parent directory from when I imported the project into Eclipse when refactoring it. Just ignore them, or use them to import the project yourself (if you want). I'm not familiar enough with git to be messing around with the git-ignore configuration so I'm just going to leave them how they are.
