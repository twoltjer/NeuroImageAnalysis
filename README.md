# NeuroImageAnalysis

NeuroImageAnalysis (also known as NIA) is a Java program for analyzing how positive a stain is on sets of images from brain slides. 

Note: this will continue to be the purpose of the program for at least the 2.0 series of releases. However, I do hope that one day this program may be more flexible. 

## What to download

The master branch now is only host to the licensing and documentation files for the NIA project. To use the NIA program, simply download and run the latest JAR file from the "patcher" branch. Note that the patcher may need to take some time to download the entire program over again, on the first run and on updates. After the first run, this program is completely capable of running offline. 


## Documentation
The documentation for this project is currently rather outdated. For this reason, the "doc" directory has been removed for the time being. Once release 2.0 of the code is ready for release, the documentation should follow shortly after, in release 2.0.1. If you wish to read the old documentation, download an older commit or release.

## Licensing
Packaged along with the project is a JAR archive with binary code from Sun Microsystems, Inc. The licences for the packaged archive are in the directory titled "LICENSES" on the master branch. If there is trouble with this usage of the binary code, I ask that you contact me and I'll remove it from the project as soon as possible. I believe that, with this arrangement, my program is easier for users to use, and that Sun gets the credit they deserve for their contribution to the project.
