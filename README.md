# NeuroImageAnalysis
Java program for analyzing how positive a stain is on sets of images from brain slides.

## How to use this program

To run this program, the following commands must be run from the repository's parent directory:
```
./compile
cd bin
java Main
```
To clean up, I've written a script to remove all files from the bin directory. It can be easily run with:
```
./clean
```
Note that this script may remove other files if it's not run from the repository's parent directory.
